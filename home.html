    <h1>Phi Mu Alpha - Upsilon Phi: Jazz Fest</h1>
</head>
<body>
    <p>Since the chapter was founded in 1968, Upsilon Phi has hosted an annual event celebrating jazz
     at Truman State University. Having been been ranked one of the top collegiate jazz festivals by
     Down Beat magazine, the Phi Mu Alpha Jazz Festival has become one of the larger events of its
     kind, attracting high school and middle school bands throughout the Midwest.</p>

    <p>Traditionally held the last weekend in February, “JazzFest” brings in nationally renowned
     artists every year. It includes a day of performances by high school and middle school jazz
     combos and big bands with a personalized clinic for each group. Our guest artist also
     presents a clinic and performs with Truman jazz groups on an evening concert.</p>

    <p>The list of past guest artists reads like a who’s who of jazz luminaries. Clark Terry,
     Nick Brignola, John Fedchock, Danilo Pérez, John Faddis, Peter Erskine, Ethan Iverson,
     and Slide Hampton are just some of the great musicians who have graced JazzFest with
     their talent and generosity. A complete listing of past guests artist can be found <a href="JazzFest/previous-festivals.html">here</a>.</p>

    <p>The men of Upsilon Phi take great pride in all the hard work required successfully
     put on such a large-scale festival every year. Not only does JazzFest support a rich
     American art form, it also helps educate aspiring young musicians.</p>
