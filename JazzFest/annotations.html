<h3>Milestone 2: PHP</h3>
<h5>
    Sign Up form processing.
</h5>
<p>
    Form processing functionality was added to the Sign Up page. Band directors can now enter in their information
    to sign up for the festival. Since there isn't a database yet the current implementation prints the fields that
    they entered in and sends an email confirmation if they checked the box allowing that. The script also will
    return an error message if required fields are blank or no bands are signed up. The entered information is
    screened for html special characters before printed to the screen. Future changes will have a table showing which
    bands have signed up so far instead of the Google Sheets showing the previous festivals bands.

<h5>Admin Page</h5>
<p>
    This page was added so that the site administrator can communicate with the band directors. The admin can login
    using PHP validation and send emails to all directors easily. Since we don't have a database we're using username
    and password being stored in the PHP code for now and a dummy list of band directors in the code. Future changes
    will migrate all of the data to mysql for more secure authentication.
