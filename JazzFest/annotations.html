<h3>Milestone 2: PHP</h3>
<h5>
    Sign Up form processing.
</h5>
<p>
    Form processing functionality was added to the Sign Up page. Band directors can now enter in their information
    to sign up for the festival. Since there isn't a database yet the current implementation prints the fields that
    they entered in and sends an email confirmation if they checked the box allowing that. The script also will
    return an error message if required fields are blank or no bands are signed up. The entered information is
    screened for html special characters before printed to the screen. Future changes will have a table showing which
    bands have signed up so far instead of the Google Sheets showing the previous festivals bands. If you want to test
    the email function you can use your email or either of ours. We've had some inconsistency issues with sand not
    always sending emails every time but it usually does.

<h5>Admin Page</h5>
<p>
    This page was added so that the site administrator can communicate with the band directors. The admin can login
    using PHP validation and send emails to all directors easily. Since we don't have a database we're using username
    and password being stored in the PHP code for now and a dummy list of band directors in the code. Future changes
    will migrate all of the data to mysql for more secure authentication.

<h5>Milestone 3: JS</h5>
<p>
    A slide show was added to the previous festivals page. There are now photos for all of the previous guest artists
    arranged into a nice dynamics slide show. The js library used in flexslider which also utilizes jquery.

    A music player has been added to the home page. This player is provided by audio.js. The song played is
    the Chapter Hymn for Upsilon Phi of Phi Mu Alpha.

    Calendar functionality has been added for scheduling for the band and worker pages. It uses the dhtmlx scheduler
    which uses js and ajax. Though most of the work is already done a lot of code modification is required in order to
    work as desired.
